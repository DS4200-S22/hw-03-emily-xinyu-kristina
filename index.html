                This chart contains multiple data types including attributes and items. Each bubble in the compound chart represents an individual entity, while the distribution within each pie chart and scatterplot locations of each bubble describe the measured ordered and sequential attributes. The marks that are depicted in this graph include the bubbles representing individual items and are categorized as both area and point marks since it differs both in size and location on the scatterplot. The channels represented in this graph include position (both horizontal and vertical), color (representing different categories on the pie chart), and size (area of the bubbles).

                This bump chart contains attribute, item, and link data types. The lines that connect each dot are links between time periods, while each color set of dots represents an individual item. Furthermore, the location of the dots is an ordinal attribute representing what year it is measured in. The marks in this chart include points and lines with the points being items/nodes and lines being links. Channels used in this graph include color (differentiating between each item) and horizontal position (signifying passage of time). Each mark is represented by a circular shape.

                In the mind map, there are data types including items represented by each individual node (labeled in the diagram above as “theme”, “idea”, and “category”), attributes representing the category of data such as theme or idea, and links that connect the nodes and show relationships between the nodes.  The mind map contains marks including areas shown as oval-like shapes and lines that connect the areas.  The areas, labeled in the image above as “theme”, “idea”, and “category”, serve to represent ideas/concepts and are used as items/nodes.  The areas have channels including red, orange, and navy colors of higher saturation, horizontal positions, oval-like two-dimensional shapes with a longer length and shorter width; each area is positioned in a way that is farther in relation to other areas with significant amounts of white space between areas.  The lines show connections between how ideas are related to other concepts/ideas and visually convey the degree of separation between these elements.  The lines are used as links of connection between various areas.  The lines also have channels including a curvy 1-dimensional shape, navy color, slightly tilted at varying angles depending on the positions of the corresponding areas and relatively long lengths positioned between every set of two areas.

            <p class= "p1">
                In the stacked bar chart, there are data types including attributes, represented by A, B, C, and D in the diagram above and links, which depict the relationships between smaller categories to the total amount, as indicated by the lengths of each stacked bar.  For marks, there are areas that act as items/nodes shown in the diagram as the colorful bars.  The areas have channels including vertical positions, varying colors including navy, various shades of red (dark to light) and orange with higher saturation, rectangular shapes, size with longer lengths and shorter widths and tilt at a straight vertical angle.  The colors of the areas visually depict how larger categories are divided into smaller categories as well as each category’s relations to the total.  The length of the area represents the quantitative amount of the total and shows visually how one category compares with the totals of the other categories.  The areas are evenly spaced out from each other.
